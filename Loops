#1)Write a Python for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

#2)Create a list of fruits (e.g., ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]) and write a for loop to print each fruit in the list.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#3)Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

sum = 0

# Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50
for number in range(1, 51):
    # Check if the number is even
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # If it's even, add it to the sum
        sum =sum+ number

# Print the sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 50 is:",sum)

#4)Create a list of integers, and using a for loop, find and print the largest number in the list.
# Input from the user to create a list of integers
num_list = []

n = int(input("Enter the number of integers in the list: "))

for i in range(n):
    num = int(input(f"Enter integer {i + 1}: "))
    num_list.append(num)

# Initialize a variable to store the largest number, starting with the first number in the list
largest = num_list[0]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list
for number in num_list:
    if number > largest:
        largest = number

# Print the largest number
print("The largest number in the list is:", largest)

#5)Write a Python program that uses a for loop to find and print all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.

print("Prime numbers between 1 and 100:")
for num in range(2, 101):  # Start from 2 as 1 is not prime
    is_prime = True
    for divisor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % divisor == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime:
        print(num)

#6)Write a Python program that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person with keys "name" and "age." Find and print the average age of all the people in the list.
# Define a list of dictionaries representing people
people = [
    {"name": "omkar", "age": 25},
    {"name": "sparsh", "age":26},
    {"name": "jatin", "age": 29},
    {"name": "mayur", "age": 30},
    {"name": "shiva", "age": 78}
]

# Calculate the total age and count of people
total_age = 0
count = len(people)

# Calculate the sum of ages
for person in people:
    total_age =total_age+ person["age"]

# Calculate the average age
if count > 0:
    average_age = total_age / count
else:
    average_age = 0

# Print the average age
print(f"The average age of the people is: {average_age}")

#7)Create a dictionary representing a simple inventory system for a store. Implement a function that allows you to update the quantity of items in the inventory by specifying the item name and the new quantity.

inventory = {
    "item1": 20,
    "item2": 29,
    "item3": 20,
}

# Function to update the quantity of an item in the inventory
def update_inventory(item_name, new_quantity):
    if item_name in inventory:
        inventory[item_name] = new_quantity
        print(f"Updated inventory for {item_name} to {new_quantity}")
    else:
        print(f"{item_name} not found in inventory. Item not updated.")

# Example usage of the update_inventory function
item_name = "item2"
new_quantity = 292
update_inventory(item_name, new_quantity)

# Print the updated inventory

print("Updated Inventory:")
for item, quantity in inventory.items():
    print(f"{item}: {quantity}")
